I saw a post this morning about a white cis woman on twitter showing Grok a picture of herself with a trans woman side by side and asking Grok who is the real woman, to prove the point that trans woman cannot "pass" as real woman by the judgement of AI.

Problem with this method is that this cis woman has a "conventionally" feminine face, if you compare her to other cis women on this planet, more than half of the cis women will not "pass" either.

This makes me realize that cis people experience gender dysphoria all the time: that’s why plastic surgery is so popular among cis women, cause only having a traditionally feminine face is being perceived as a real woman. Also notice that the “traditionally feminine face” in question is usually from a cis woman of European descent; when right wing people trying to insult Michelle Obama, they usually use conspiracy theories such as she is a trans woman and was born a man, since she does not fit the Eurocentric beauty standards (Yes, race and gender always come hand in hand and I’ll die on this hill).

Same goes for cis men, for which the workout/looksmaxxing culture has become extremely popular among the red-pilled community, and if you don’t have a distinctive jawline with positive canthal tilt greater than 180 degree you will fail miserably at being a man, since the whole purpose of your life is to be perceived and accepted by your hommies as a real man in a totally not gay way, and to play the role of what is considered to be a "functional man" in a heteronormative society.

Body modifications such as plastic surgery and workout/looksmaxxing are like HRT and gender-affirming surgery for cis women and men.

RuPaul said “we are born naked, and the rest is drag”. This beautiful quote strikes me in so many ways. No matter if you identify as cis or trans, we are always taught to perform our gender to some extent to enforce the existing social construct.
