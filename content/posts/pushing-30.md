I was born in 2000, which makes it very convenient to calculate my own age - just take the last two digits of the current year. And the number 26 just feels so fucking surreal.

I can’t believe I will be 26 soon and I’m currently closer to my 30 than my 20.

When I look in the mirror, I see a 20-year-old who is in their second year of their university and worries about group projects. But in reality, I have a “real” job, pay rents and bills and make "adult" decisions.

Everyday when I go to work, I still wear the same backpack I own since I was a student. I have never worn high heels or a “business” outfit my whole life, and am not planning to own them any soon.

During my visit to the dental clinic last year, my dentist asked me if I was 16 as a small talk starter. I was utterly shocked and disturbed by this seemingly harmless question. After learning about my real age, he laughed awkwardly and went silent for a while. This is my personal 9/11 and has added a new layer to my existing identity crisis since then.

My disconnection from my gender, race and age on the paper results in a lack of sense of belonging. I feel like a spirit floating in the universe without attaching to anything. It gives me the maximum freedom I could have but also chronically loneliness. Also, the freedom comes with it is only the freedom I give to myself, not others granted to me. I allow myself to not fit into any group, but the peer pressure from the outside always forces me to do it otherwise.

So I guess my biggest fear about getting old is not about physical or mental decline. I am afraid that the gap between how others perceive me and how I feel about myself will get wider and wider, which makes it harder to have a core identity.

I feel like in the end we all need to wear some kind of costumes to feel comfortable in our own bodies. Maybe I will find my costume to wear in 2026, maybe I will feel more confident being naked, I don't know, I'm still navigating through life and figuring our a lot of things about myself.
